    action: forcemerge
    description: >-
      forceMerge indices between {{FORCEMERGE_FROM_DAY}} and {{FORCEMERGE_TO_DAY}} days old
      to {{FORCEMERGE_SEGMENTS}} segments per shard.  Delay {{FORCEMERGE_DELAY}} seconds between each
      forceMerge operation to allow the cluster to quiesce.
      This action will ignore indices already forceMerged to the same or fewer
      number of segments per shard, so the 'forcemerged' filter is unneeded.
    options:
      max_num_segments: {{FORCEMERGE_SEGMENTS}}
      delay: {{FORCEMERGE_DELAY}}
      timeout_override: {{FORCEMERGE_TIMEOUT}}
      continue_if_exception: True
